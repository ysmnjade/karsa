                        meat-based dishes. After all, the name itself is a collab of the

                        <br> In its original home, Karsa Restaurant, you’ll find the sauce  
                        incorporated into many culinary creations across the Karsa menu 
                        from rice meals to their signature sandwich series. It’s one of  
                        those ‘sauce maketh the meal’ moments. Serving steaming in a 
                        silver cup, pour it over your dish of choice and chomp down as a  
                        surge of Filipino flavor brings your appetite home. Refill and top off

      <h1 class="content2">THE KARSA STORY</h1>
      <p id="content2"> <br> Have you ever had a food craving so intense, so specific, that 
                        after appeasing it—it grew into something more? This was the 
                        scenario that began the flight of Karsa®. A late night craving in a 
                        foreign country and on a long-awaited day-off. 

                        <br>

                        <br> Gracey and Erwin were at their home in Dubai one night when 
                        Erwin craved for something familiar. As if by instinct, Gracey 
                        prepared something she knew he’d enjoy but with a little  
                        meaningful twist—a sauce. The spontaneous recipe turned into a  
                        requested delicacy and they both knew it had to be shared with  
                        the homeland that started it all. 

                        <br>

                        <br> The savored flavor crossed the ocean and made its way to the 
                        Philippines like it was heading home. They’d have cook-offs with  
                        amily, relatives and friends, and this flavor-style always came on  
                        top in those trials. Just like their relationship, the sauce evolved  
                        alongside Gracey and Erwin, and succeeded to be the Karsa taste 
                        we know and love today. <br> </p>

      <p id="content3"> <br> What makes food — Filipino? This is what Pan de Karsa 
                        constantly attempts to answer with every fresh rendition since it  
                        was made. Filipino food is usually sweet (no less). It’s saucy  
                        (could be saucier). And it’s got that little kick of spice just to get the 
                        mood going.

                        hat’s graced many silid kainans. The sub is then glazed with the 
                        signature Karsa Sauce for that extra cozy aroma and warmth. Pan 
                        de Series is the recipe model of today’s Filipino sandwiches. <br> </p>
